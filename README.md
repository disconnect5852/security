# security
testing spring security, testing of testing, simple rest api, trying out postman, not product quality, etc.

Few unit tests, but springboot acts weirdly (bypassing, "cheating", in authentication), also there are phantom queries after creating new on disk DB, so a little follow-up is required... when developing a real use application

maven project, DB prepared to use, just start the application, or run the junit tests. Some validation is only enabled at DB level, and spring checking the JSON input.

I tried to figure out what the poet was thinking ("Mire gondolt a költő" :) ), with the API functions, and the tables, but most of the table fields were dunno what for.
